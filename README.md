The 6DOF_Robot is a versatile platform featuring:
- **Quadruped Mobility**: Walks on four legs or rolls on tracks.
- **Tracked Movement**: Powered by DC motors for rugged terrain.
- **6DOF Robotic Arm**: Capable of complex manipulation tasks.

This project builds upon and enhances the design from [oshwhub.com/imumu/si-zu-lv-dai-ji-qi-ren](https://oshwhub.com/imumu/si-zu-lv-dai-ji-qi-ren). âœ¨
